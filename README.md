# Securing_Data_with_Blockchain_using_IPFS
Distributed storage develops to reduce the
cost of the server side hardware and increase data availability.
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol for distributed
storage. IPFS stores immutable data, remove duplication, and
obtain address information for storage nodes to search for files
in the network. Many DApps have been created with the use of
these technologies and one example is to use this design for a
decentralized systems that is resistant to censorship
and single point of failure. This project involves researching the
blockchain technology and implementing a decentralised data
stroage application on the Ethereum private blockchain with
the use of smart contract and IPFS
